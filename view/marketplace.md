TBC: more coming soon. @TODO - instructions on how to create your own module, instructions on how to deploy to smartresolution.org (for now, link to GitHub repo would suffice!), etc.

There is currently only one module for SmartResolution: the [Maritime Collision module](https://github.com/ChrisBAshton/smartresolution-module-maritime-collision), which offers a custom dispute type of 'Maritime Collision'.

It asks specific, structured questions to the agents, performs some AI logic and renders a court simulation, suggesting what the outcome of the dispute might be should it be taken to court.
