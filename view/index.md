# SmartResolution

SmartResolution is an open-source Online Dispute Resolution platform which is:

* Free and open source software (FOSS), meaning anyone can install the software for any purpose.
* Fully extensible, meaning developers can write modules that can be plugged into any installation of SmartResolution.
* Enterprise level, backed up by integration and unit tests, continuous integration, CodeClimate and other tools.
