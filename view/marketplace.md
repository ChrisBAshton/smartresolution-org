TBC: more coming soon.

There is currently only one module for SmartResolution: the [Maritime Collision module](https://github.com/ChrisBAshton/smartresolution-module-maritime-collision), which offers a custom dispute type of 'Maritime Collision'.

It asks specific, structured questions to the agents, performs some AI logic and renders a court simulation, suggesting what the outcome of the dispute might be should it be taken to court.
