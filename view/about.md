# Online Dispute Resolution for Maritime Collisions
This repository contains the codebase for my Major Project (i.e. dissertation) at Aberystwyth University, and is currently a work in progress.

## Overview

When it comes to resolving disputes, many people are increasingly turning to online dispute resolution (ODS) platforms as an alternative to taking the case to court, settling disputes more quickly, conveniently, and at a lower cost.

These platforms already exist; they allow lawyers to open disputes on behalf of their clients, upload documents and type content in a structured manner, and hopefully reach an amicable resolution. However, there is no business logic that helps influence the outcome of a dispute. Resolution is a manual process performed by the lawyers.

Online Dispute Resolution for Maritime Collisions will attempt to introduce that business logic in an abstract way so that a module containing maritime law business logic can be plugged into the system. It will ask relevant, structured questions, interpret the answers by both parties and play out a ”court simulation” indicating the outcome of the case should the dispute be taken to court. It may also retrieve similar historic cases which can be fed into the simulation.
