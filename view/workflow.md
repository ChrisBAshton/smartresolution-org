# SmartResolution Workflow

When it comes to resolving disputes, many people are increasingly turning to online dispute resolution (ODS) platforms as an alternative to taking the case to court, settling disputes more quickly, conveniently, and at a lower cost.

## Roles in the system

![Roles in the system](/view/images/roles.jpg)

From left to right, we have:

* Law Firm - an Organisation account.
* Agent - an Individual account, belonging to a Law Firm.
* Mediation Centre - an Organisation account.
* Mediator - an Individual account, belonging to a Mediation Centre.

## Creating a dispute

### Assigning the dispute to the relevant parties

![Creating a dispute](/view/images/dispute_creation.jpg)

* Law Firm A creates a dispute, assigning it to Agent A.
* Agent A fills in their summary for the dispute and opens the dispute against Law Firm B.
* Law Firm B assigns the dispute to Agent B.
* Agent B fills in their summary to accept the dispute.

### Negotiating a lifespan

The agents need to agree on a start and end time for the dispute. A dispute can last for hours, weeks or months, depending on the preferences of the agents involved.

A lifespan can be re-negotiated at any point in the dispute process.

With a lifespan negotiated and a dispute fully assigned, the agents are now able to communicate through the SmartResolution chat facility and upload documents as evidence.

## Mediation

Sometimes, disputes may not be solved without the aid of an independent mediator. SmartResolution supports Mediation Centres and Mediators: at any point in an active dispute, either agent can propose mediation.

* An agent proposes to use Mediation Centre 'MC' to mediate the dispute.
* The other agent accepts. 'MC' is notified that they are now the Mediation Centre of the dispute.
* 'MC' provides a list of all available Mediators.
* The agents are free to peruse the profiles of the Mediators, reading their CVs and contacting them externally if necessary.
* An agent proposes to use Mediator M to mediate the dispute.
* The other agent agrees. The dispute is now in mediation.

![Mediation in action](/view/images/mediation.jpg)

With the dispute in mediation, all communication is done through the mediator, unless the mediator proposes "Round-Table Communication" and both agents accept. In this case, a three-person chat is unlocked. At any time, either agent can revoke Round-Table Communication.
